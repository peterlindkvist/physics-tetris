# Physics tetris
This is an import of some old code I wrote in 2008, this is just for nostalgica and backup. I take no responsibility for the code :)

## Background

I think most variants of the classic tetris game has been built already for about 20 years ago. But I thought I could give it a try and build one with a physics engine.

## Installation
I don't remember, probably some [mtasc](http://www.mtasc.org/) command.
